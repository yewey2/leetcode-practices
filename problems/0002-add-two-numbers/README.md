- Solved: TBD

Approach: Recursive addition with carry. At each step, sum the current digits and carry to form a new node, recurse on `next` nodes, and terminate when both lists and carry are empty.

To improve: Add time/space analysis and edge-case notes; consider an iterative version for comparison.
